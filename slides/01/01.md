# Reinforcement Learning

**Reinforcement learning** is a machine learning paradigm, different from
_supervised_ and _unsupervised learning_.

~~~
The essence of reinforcement learning is to learn from _interactions_ with the
environment to maximize a numeric _reward_ signal.
~~~
The learner is not told which actions to take, and the actions may affect not
just the immediate reward, but also all following rewards.

# Deep Reinforcement Learning

In the last decade, reinforcement learning has been successfully combined with
_deep NNs_.

# Course Requirements

## Practicals
~~~

- There will be about 2-3 assignments a week, each with a 2-week deadline.
~~~
  - There is also another week-long second deadline, but for fewer points.
~~~
- After solving the assignment, you get non-bonus points, and sometimes also
  bonus points.
~~~
- To pass the practicals, you need to get **80 non-bonus points**. There will be
  assignments for at least 120 non-bonus points.
~~~
- If you get more than 80 points (be it bonus or non-bonus), they will be
  all transferred to the exam. Additionally, if you solve **all the
  assignments**, you pass the exam with grade 1.

~~~
## Lecture

You need to pass a written exam (or solve all the assignments).
~~~
- All questions are publicly listed on the course website.
~~~
- There are questions for 100 points in every exam, plus the surplus
  points from the practicals and plus at most 10 surplus points for **community
  work** (improving slides, ‚Ä¶).
~~~
- You need 60/75/90 points to pass with grade 3/2/1.

# Multi-armed Bandits

We start by selecting an action $A_1$ (the index of the arm to use), and we
obtain a reward $R_1$. We then repeat the process by selecting an action $A_2$,
obtaining $R_2$, selecting $A_3$, ‚Ä¶, with the indices denoting the time step
when the actions and rewards occurred.

~~~
Let $q_*(a)$ be the real **value** of an action $a$:
$$q_*(a) = ùîº[R_t | A_t = a].$$

~~~
Assuming our goal is to maximize the sum of rewards $\sum_i R_i$, the optimal
strategy is to repeatedly perform the action with the largest value $q_*(a)$.

---
# Multi-armed Bandits

However we do not know the real action values $q_*(a) = ùîº[R_t | A_t = a]$.

~~~
Therefore, we will try to estimate them, denoting $Q_t(a)$ our estimated value
of action $a$ at time $t$ (before taking the trial $t$).

~~~
A natural way to estimate $Q_t(a)$ is to average the observed rewards:
$$Q_t(a) ‚âù \frac{\textrm{sum of rewards when action }a\textrm{ is taken}}{\textrm{number of times action }a\textrm{ was taken}}.$$

~~~
Utilizing our estimates $Q_t(a)$, we define the **greedy action** $A_t$ as
$$A_t ‚âù \argmax_a Q_t(a).$$

~~~
When our estimates are accurate enough, the optimal strategy is to repeatedly
perform the greedy action.

# Law of Large Numbers

Let $X_1, X_2, ‚Ä¶, X_n$ are independent and identically distributed (iid) random
variables with finite mean $ùîº\big[X_i\big] = Œº < ‚àû$, and let
$$XÃÑ_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^N X_i.$$

~~~
## Weak Law of Large Numbers

The average $XÃÑ_N$ converges in probability to $Œº$:
$$XÃÑ_n \stackrel{p}{\rightarrow} Œº \textrm{~~when~~} n ‚Üí ‚àû\textrm{,~~i.e.,~~}\lim_{n ‚Üí ‚àû} P\big(|XÃÑ_n - Œº|<Œµ\big) = 1.$$

~~~
## Strong Law of Large Numbers

The average $XÃÑ_N$ converges to $Œº$ almost surely:
$$XÃÑ_n \stackrel{a.s.}{\longrightarrow} Œº \textrm{~~when~~} n ‚Üí ‚àû\textrm{,~~i.e.,~~}P\Big(\lim_{n ‚Üí ‚àû} XÃÑ_n = Œº\Big) = 1.$$

---
# Exploitation versus Exploration

Choosing a greedy action is **exploitation** of current estimates. We however also
need to **explore** the space of actions to improve our estimates.

~~~
To make sure our estimates converge to the true values, we need to sample every
action unlimited number of times.

~~~
An _$Œµ$-greedy_ method follows the greedy action with probability $1-Œµ$, and
chooses a uniformly random action with probability $Œµ$.

---
# $Œµ$-greedy Method

![w=87%,mw=60%,h=center,f=right](e_greedy.svgz)

Considering the 10-armed bandit problem:

- we generate 2000 random instances

  - each $q_*(a)$ is sampled from $ùìù(0, 1)$

~~~
- for every instance, we run 1000 steps of the $Œµ$-greedy method
  - we consider $Œµ$ of 0, 0.01, 0.1

~~~
- we plot the averaged results over the 2000 instances

---
# Computing the Averages $Q_n$

## Incremental Implementation

Let $Q_{n+1}$ be an estimate using $n$ rewards $R_1, \ldots, R_n$.

~~~
$\displaystyle\kern14em{}\mathllap{Q_{n+1}} = \frac{1}{n} ‚àë_{i=1}^n R_i$

~~~
$\displaystyle\kern14em{} = \frac{1}{n} \Bigg(‚àë_{i=1}^{n-1} R_i + R_n\Bigg)$

~~~
$\displaystyle\kern14em{} = \frac{1}{n} \Bigg(\frac{n-1}{\textcolor{blue}{n-1}} \textcolor{blue}{‚àë_{i=1}^{n-1} R_i} + R_n\Bigg)$

~~~
$\displaystyle\kern14em{} = \frac{n-1}{n} \textcolor{blue}{Q_n} + \frac{1}{n}R_n$

~~~
$\displaystyle\kern14em{} = Q_n + \frac{1}{n}\Big(R_n - Q_n\Big)$

# $Œµ$-greedy Method Algorithm

![w=100%,v=middle](bandits_algorithm.svgz)

---
# Fixed Learning Rate

Analogously to the solution obtained for a stationary problem, we consider
$$Q_{n+1} = Q_n + Œ±(R_n - Q_n).$$

~~~
Converges to the true action values if
$$‚àë_{n=1}^‚àû Œ±_n = ‚àû \textrm{~~~~and~~~~}‚àë_{n=1}^‚àû Œ±_n^2 < ‚àû.$$

~~~
Biased method, because
$$Q_{n+1} = (1 - Œ±)^n Q_1 + ‚àë_{i=1}^n Œ±(1-Œ±)^{n-i} R_i.$$

~~~
The bias can be utilized to support exploration at the start of the episode by
setting the initial values to more than the expected value of the optimal
solution.

# Markov Decision Process

![w=47%,h=center](mdp.svgz)

A **Markov decision process** (MDP) is a quadruple $(ùì¢, ùìê, p, Œ≥)$,
where:
- $ùì¢$ is a set of states,
~~~
- $ùìê$ is a set of actions,
~~~
- $p(S_{t+1} = s', R_{t+1} = r | S_t = s, A_t = a)$ is a probability that
  action $a ‚àà ùìê$ will lead from state $s ‚àà ùì¢$ to $s' ‚àà ùì¢$, producing a **reward** $r ‚àà ‚Ñù$,
~~~
- $Œ≥ ‚àà [0, 1]$ is a **discount factor**.

~~~
Let a **return** $G_t$ be $G_t ‚âù ‚àë_{k=0}^‚àû Œ≥^k R_{t + 1 + k}$. The goal is to optimize $ùîº[G_0]$.

---
# Markov Decision Process

We cannot replace
- $p(S_{t+1} = s', R_{t+1} = r | S_t = s, A_t = a)$ is a probability that
  action $a ‚àà ùìê$ will lead from state $s ‚àà ùì¢$ to $s' ‚àà ùì¢$, producing a **reward** $r ‚àà ‚Ñù$,

by
- $p(S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = s, A_t = a)$, a transition probability,
- $r(R_{t+1} = r | S_t = s, A_t = a)$, a reward probability.

~~~
because the reward might depend on $S_{t+1}$.

~~~
However, we could use
- $p(S_{t+1} = s' | S_t = s, A_t = a)$, a transition probability,
- $r(R_{t+1} = r | S_{t+1} = s', S_t = s, A_t = a)$, a reward probability.

---
# Multi-armed Bandits as MDP

To formulate $n$-armed bandits problem as MDP, we do not need states.
Therefore, we could formulate it as:
- one-element set of states, $ùì¢=\{S\}$;
~~~
- an action for every arm, $ùìê=\{a_1, a_2, ‚Ä¶, a_n\}$;
~~~
- assuming every arm produces rewards with a distribution of $ùìù(Œº_i, œÉ_i^2)$,
  the MDP dynamics function $p$ is defined as
  $$p(S, r | S, a_i) = ùìù(r | Œº_i, œÉ_i^2).$$

~~~
One possibility to introduce states in multi-armed bandits problem is to
consider a separate reward distribution for every state. Such generalization is
called **Contextualized Bandits** problem. Assuming state transitions are
independent on rewards and given by a distribution $\textit{next}(s)$, the MDP
dynamics function for contextualized bandits problem is given by
$$p(s', r | s, a_i) = ùìù(r | Œº_{i,s}, œÉ_{i,s}^2) ‚ãÖ \textit{next}(s'|s).$$

section: POMDP
# Partially Observable MDPs

Recall that the Markov decision process is a quadruple $(ùì¢, ùìê, p, Œ≥)$,
where:
- $ùì¢$ is a set of states,
- $ùìê$ is a set of actions,
- $p(S_{t+1} = s', R_{t+1} = r | S_t = s, A_t = a)$ is a probability that
  action $a ‚àà ùìê$ will lead from state $s ‚àà ùì¢$ to $s' ‚àà ùì¢$, producing a reward $r ‚àà ‚Ñù$,
- $Œ≥ ‚àà [0, 1]$ is a discount factor.

~~~
![w=46%,f=right](pomdp.svgz)

**Partially observable Markov decision process** extends the Markov decision
process to a sextuple $(ùì¢, ùìê, p, Œ≥, ùìû, o)$, where in addition to an MDP,
- $ùìû$ is a set of observations,
- $o(O_{t+1} | S_{t+1}, A_t)$ is an observation model, where observation $O_t$ is used as agent input
  instead of the state $S_t$.

section: POMDP
# Partially Observable MDPs

Planning in a general POMDP is in theory undecidable.
~~~
- Nevertheless, several approaches are used to handle POMDPs in robotics
  - to model uncertainty, imprecise mechanisms and inaccurate sensors, ‚Ä¶
  - consider for example robotic vacuum cleaners

~~~

Partially observable MDPs are needed to model many environments
(maze navigation, FPS games, ‚Ä¶).
~~~
- We will initially assume all environments are fully observable, even if some
  of them will not.
~~~
- Later we will mention solutions, where partially observable MDPs are handled
  using recurrent networks (or networks with external memory), which model the
  latent states $S_t$.

section: MDP
# Episodic and Continuing Tasks

If the agent-environment interaction naturally breaks into independent
subsequences, usually called **episodes**, we talk about **episodic tasks**.
Each episode then ends in a special **terminal state**, followed by a reset
to a starting state (either always the same, or sampled from a distribution
of starting states).

~~~
In episodic tasks, it is often the case that every episode ends in at most
$H$ steps. These **finite-horizon tasks** then can use discount factor $Œ≥=1$,
because the return $G ‚âù ‚àë_{t=0}^H Œ≥^t R_{t + 1}$ is well defined.

~~~
If the agent-environment interaction goes on and on without a limit, we instead
talk about **continuing tasks**. In this case, the discount factor $Œ≥$ needs
to be sharply smaller than 1.

# (State-)Value Function and Action-Value Function

A **policy** $œÄ$ computes a distribution of actions in a given state, i.e.,
$œÄ(a | s)$ corresponds to a probability of performing an action $a$ in state
$s$.

~~~
To evaluate a quality of a policy, we define **value function** $v_œÄ(s)$, or
**state-value function**, as
$$\begin{aligned}
  v_œÄ(s) & ‚âù ùîº_œÄ\big[G_t \big| S_t = s\big] = ùîº_œÄ\left[‚àë\nolimits_{k=0}^‚àû Œ≥^k R_{t+k+1} \middle| S_t=s\right] \\
         & = ùîº_{A_t ‚àº œÄ(s)} ùîº_{S_{t+1},R_{t+1} ‚àº p(s,A_t)} \big[R_{t+1} + Œ≥v_œÄ(S_{t+1})\big] \\
         & = ùîº_{A_t ‚àº œÄ(s)} ùîº_{S_{t+1},R_{t+1} ‚àº p(s,A_t)} \big[R_{t+1}
           + Œ≥ ùîº_{A_{t+1} ‚àº œÄ(S_{t+1})} ùîº_{S_{t+2},R_{t+2} ‚àº p(S_{t+1},A_{t+1})} \big[R_{t+2} + ‚Ä¶ \big]\big]
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
An **action-value function** for a policy $œÄ$ is defined analogously as
$$q_œÄ(s, a) ‚âù ùîº_œÄ\big[G_t \big| S_t = s, A_t = a\big] = ùîº_œÄ\left[‚àë\nolimits_{k=0}^‚àû Œ≥^k R_{t+k+1} \middle| S_t=s, A_t = a\right].$$

~~~
The value function and action-value function can be of course expressed using one another:
$$v_œÄ(s) = ùîº_{a‚àºœÄ}\big[q_œÄ(s, a)\big],~~~~~~~q_œÄ(s, a) = ùîº_{s', r ‚àº p}\big[r + Œ≥v_œÄ(s')\big].$$

---
# (State-)Value Function and Action-Value Function

Consider the following simple gridworld environment:
- the cells corresponding to states
- four actions _north_, _east_, _south_, _west_ available from all states
- reward -1 when action would take an agent off the grid (no movement in that
  case)
- reward +10 and +5 in the two special cells below, with the next state
  always the indicated one independently on the action; reward 0 otherwise
- discount $Œ≥ = 0.9$

![w=88%,h=center](gridworld_uniform_policy.svgz)

---
# Optimal Value Functions

Optimal state-value function is defined as
$$v_*(s) ‚âù \max_œÄ v_œÄ(s),$$
~~~
analogously
$$q_*(s, a) ‚âù \max_œÄ q_œÄ(s, a).$$

~~~
Any policy $œÄ_*$ with $v_{œÄ_*} = v_*$ is called an **optimal policy**. Such policy
can be defined as $œÄ_*(s) ‚âù \argmax_a q_*(s, a) = \argmax_a ùîº\big[R_{t+1} + Œ≥v_*(S_{t+1}) | S_t = s, A_t = a\big]$.
When multiple actions maximize $q_*(s, a)$, the optimal policy can
stochastically choose any of them.

~~~
## Existence
In finite-horizon tasks or if $Œ≥ < 1$, there always exists a unique optimal
state-value function, a¬†unique optimal action-value function, and a (not necessarily
unique) optimal policy.

---
# Optimal Value Functions

Here are the unique optimal value function and non-unique optimal policy

class: section
# Monte Carlo Methods

---
# Monte Carlo Prediction

Assuming we have a fixed policy $œÄ$ and that we want to estimate $v_œÄ(s)$.

~~~
A Monte Carlo method to estimate this value function would be to simulate
many episodes, and then compute an average _return_ for all visited states:
$$V(s) ‚âà ùîº[G_t | S_t = s].$$

~~~
Some states might be visited multiple times; in that case, we could use
~~~
- **first-visit** Monte Carlo method, where only the first occurrence of
  the state is considered;
~~~
- **every-visit** Monte Carlo method, where all occurrences of the state are
  considered.

~~~
By the law of large numbers, the Monte Carlo estimate converges to the
real value function for all visited states.
~~~
- For every-visit MC, the situation is more complicated, because multiple returns
  from a single state in a single episode are not independent; but it can be
  also proven that even every-visit Monte Carlo converges.

# Monte Carlo Control

We now present the first algorithm for computing optimal behavior without assuming
a knowledge of the environment dynamics.

However, we still assume there are finitely many states $ùì¢$ and we will store
estimates for each of them (a _tabular_ method).

~~~
Monte Carlo methods are based on estimating returns from complete episodes.
Specifically, they try to estimate
$$Q(s, a) ‚âà ùîº[G_t | S_t = s, A_t = a].$$

~~~
With such estimates, a greedy action in state $S_t$ can be computed as
$$A_t = \argmax_a Q(S_t, a).$$

~~~
To hope for convergence, we need to visit each state-action pair infinitely many times.
One of the simplest way to achieve that is to assume **exploring starts**, where
we randomly select the first state and first action, and behave greedily
afterwards.

# Monte Carlo and $Œµ$-soft Behavior

The problem with exploring starts is that in many situations, we either cannot
start in an arbitrary state, or it is impractical.

~~~
Instead of choosing random state at the beginning, we can consider adding
‚Äúrandomness‚Äù gradually ‚Äì for a given $Œµ$, we set the probability of choosing any
action to be at least
$$\frac{Œµ}{|ùìê(s)|}$$
in each step. Such behavior is called _$Œµ$-soft_.

~~~
In an $Œµ$-soft behavior, selecting an action greedily (the $Œµ$-greedy
behavior) means one action has a maximum probability of
$$1-Œµ+\frac{Œµ}{|A(s)|}.$$

~~~
We now present Monte Carlo algorithm with $Œµ$-greedy action selection.

### On-policy every-visit Monte Carlo for $Œµ$-soft Policies
Algorithm parameter: small $Œµ>0$

Initialize $Q(s, a) ‚àà ‚Ñù$ arbitrarily (usually to 0), for all $s ‚àà ùì¢, a ‚àà ùìê$<br>
Initialize $C(s, a) ‚àà ‚Ñ§$ to 0, for all $s ‚àà ùì¢, a ‚àà ùìê$

Repeat forever (for each episode):
- Generate an episode $S_0, A_0, R_1, ‚Ä¶, S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}, R_T$,
  by generating actions as follows:
  - With probability $Œµ$, generate a random uniform action
  - Otherwise, set $A_t ‚âù \argmax\nolimits_a Q(S_t, a)$
- $G ‚Üê 0$
- For each $t=T-1, T-2, ‚Ä¶, 0$:
  - $G ‚Üê Œ≥G + R_{t+1}$
  - $C(S_t, A_t) ‚Üê C(S_t, A_t) + 1$
  - $Q(S_t, A_t) ‚Üê Q(S_t, A_t) + \frac{1}{C(S_t, A_t)}(G - Q(S_t, A_t))$
