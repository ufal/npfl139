### Assignment: az_quiz_cpp

In addition to the Python template for `az_quiz`, you can also use
[az_quiz_cpp](https://github.com/ufal/npfl139/tree/master/labs/12/az_quiz_cpp),
which is a directory containing a skeleton of C++ MCTS and self-play implementation.
Utilizing the C++ implementation is not required, but it offers a large speedup
(up to 10 times on a multi-core CPU and up to 50-100 times on a GPU). See
[README.md](https://github.com/ufal/npfl139/tree/master/labs/12/az_quiz_cpp/README.md)
for more information.
