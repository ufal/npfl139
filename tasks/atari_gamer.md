#### Points: 4 points

In this long-term assignment, your goal is to solve one of the
[Atari games](https://ale.farama.org/environments/). Currently, you can choose
one of the following games:
- [Pong](https://ale.farama.org/environments/pong/) (one of the easiest games),
  where you must surpass the average return of 16 in 10 episodes
- [Breakout](https://ale.farama.org/environments/breakout/) (a more difficult
  one game), where you must surpass the average return of 200 in 10 episodes.

If you would like to train an agent for a different Atari game, write us on
Piazza, and we will decide the required score and add it to the list. Note that
you can play any Atari game interactively with WASD and SPACE using the
`python3 -m npfl139.envs.atari_interactive GAME_NAME [--zoom=4] [--frame_skip=1]`
command, so for example `python3 -m npfl139.envs.atari_interactive Pong`.

The template [atari_gamer.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl139/tree/master/labs/06/atari_gamer.py)
shows how to create the Atari environment. While you can use any algorithm from
the lecture to solve the environment, some distributional DQN approach
(C51/QR-DQN/IQN) is a reasonable choice (as is the PPO algorithm). The
time limit in ReCodEx is 15 minutes.
