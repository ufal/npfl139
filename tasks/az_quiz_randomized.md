### Assignment: az_quiz_randomized
#### Date: Deadline: Jun 28, 22:00
#### Points: 5 points; either this or `pisqorky` is required for automatically passing the exam

Extend the `az_quiz` assignment to handle the possibility of wrong
answers. Therefore, when choosing a field (an action), you might not
claim it; in such a case, the state of the field becomes “failed”. When
a “failed” field is chosen as an action by a player, then either
- it is successfully claimed by the player (they “answer correctly”); or
- if the player “answers incorrectly”, the field is claimed by the opposing
  player; however, in this case, the original player continue playing
  (i.e., the players do not alternate in this case).

To instantiate this randomized game variant, pass `randomized=True`
to the `AZQuiz` class of [az_quiz.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl139/tree/past-2324/labs/11/az_quiz.py).

Your goal is to propose how to modify the Monte Carlo Tree Search to properly
handle stochastic MDPs. The information about distribution of possible next
states is provided by the `AZQuiz.all_moves` method, which returns a list of
`(probability, az_quiz_instance)` next states (in our environment, there are
always two possible next states).

Your implementation must be capable of training and achieve at least 90% win
rate against the simple heuristic. Additionally, part of this assignment is
to also write us on Piazza (once you pass in ReCodEx) a description of how
you handle the stochasticity in MCTS; you will get points only after we finish
the discussion.
