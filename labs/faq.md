### TOC: FAQ

### TOCEntry: Install

- _What Python version to use_

  The recommended Python version is **3.11**. This version is used by ReCodEx to
  evaluate your solutions. Supported Python versions are 3.11–3.13 (some
  dependencies do not yet provide wheels for Python 3.14).

  You can find out the version of your Python installation using `python3 --version`.

- _Installing to central user packages repository_

  You can install all required packages to central user packages repository using
  `python3 -m pip install --user --no-cache-dir --extra-index-url=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128 npfl139`.

  On Linux and Windows, the above command installs CUDA 12.8 PyTorch build, but you can change `cu128` to:
  - `cpu` to get CPU-only (smaller) version,
  - `cu124` to get CUDA 12.4 build,
  - `rocm7.1` to get AMD ROCm 7.1 build (Linux only).

  On macOS, the `--extra-index-url` has no effect and the Metal support is
  installed in any case.

  **To update the `npfl139` package later, use `python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade npfl139`.**
- _Installing to a virtual environment_

  Python supports virtual environments, which are directories containing
  independent sets of installed packages. You can create a virtual environment
  by running `python3 -m venv VENV_DIR` followed by
  `VENV_DIR/bin/pip install --no-cache-dir --extra-index-url=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128 npfl139`.
  (or `VENV_DIR/Scripts/pip` on Windows).

  Again, apart from the CUDA 12.8 build, you can change `cu128` on Linux and
  Windows to:
  - `cpu` to get CPU-only (smaller) version,
  - `cu126` to get CUDA 12.6 build,
  - `rocm7.1` to get AMD ROCm 7.1 build (Linux only).

  **To update the `npfl139` package later, use `VENV_DIR/bin/pip install --upgrade npfl139`.**

- _**Windows** installation_

  - On Windows, it can happen that `python3` is not in PATH, while `py` command
    is – in that case you can use `py -m venv VENV_DIR`, which uses the newest
    Python available, or for example `py -3.11 -m venv VENV_DIR`, which uses
    Python version 3.11.

  - If **MuJoCo environments fail** during construction, make sure the path of
    the Python site packages contains no non-ASCII characters. If it does, you
    can create a new virtual environment in a suitable directory to circumvent
    the problem.

  - If you encounter a problem creating the logs in the `args.logdir` directory,
    a possible cause is that the path is longer than 260 characters, which is
    the default maximum length of a complete path on Windows. However, you can
    increase this limit on Windows 10, version 1607 or later, by following
    the [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation).

  - If you encounter an `Import Error: DLL load failed`, install the VS 2017 Redistributable
    as described in the [official documentation](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/windows.html#import-error).

- _**MacOS** installation_

  - If you encounter issues with SSL certificates (_certificate verify failed:
    self-signed certificate in certificate chain_), you probably need to run the
    `Install Certificates.command`, which should be executed after installation;
    see https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#installation-steps.

- _**GPU** support on Linux and Windows_

  PyTorch supports NVIDIA GPU or AMD GPU out of the box, you just need to select
  appropriate `--extra-index-url` when installing the packages.

  If you encounter problems loading CUDA or cuDNN libraries, make sure your
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` does not contain paths to older CUDA/cuDNN libraries.

### TOCEntry: Git

- _Is it possible to keep the solutions in a Git repository?_

  Definitely. Keeping the solutions in a branch of your repository,
  where you merge them with the course repository, is probably a good idea.
  However, please keep the cloned repository with your solutions **private**.

- _On GitHub, do not create a **public** fork containing **your solutions**._

  If you keep your solutions in a GitHub repository, please do not create
  a clone of the repository by using the Fork button; this way, the cloned
  repository would be **public**.
  - If you created a public fork and want to make it private, you need to start
    by pressing **Leave fork network** in the repository settings; only then you
    can change the visibility to **private**.

  Of course, if you want to create a pull request, GitHub requires a public
  fork and you need to create it, just do not store your solutions in it (so you
  might end up with two repositories, a public fork for pull requests and
  a private repo for your own solutions).

- _How to clone the course repository?_

  To clone the course repository, run
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ufal/npfl139
  ```
  This creates the repository in the `npfl139` subdirectory; if you want a different
  name, add it as an additional parameter.

  To update the repository, run `git pull` inside the repository directory.

- _How to merge the course repository updates into a private repository with additional changes?_

  It is possible to have a private repository that combines your solutions and
  the updates from the course repository. To do that, start by cloning your
  empty private repository, and then run the following commands in it:
  ```
  git remote add course_repo https://github.com/ufal/npfl139
  git fetch course_repo
  git checkout --no-track course_repo/master
  ```
  This creates a new remote `course_repo` and a clone of the `master` branch
  from it; however, `git pull` and `git push` in this branch will operate
  on the repository your cloned originally.

  To update your branch with the changes from the course repository, run
  ```
  git fetch course_repo
  git merge course_repo/master
  ```
  while in your branch (the command `git pull --no-rebase course_repo master`
  has the same effect). Of course, it might be necessary to resolve conflicts
  if both you and the course repository modified the same lines in the same files.

### TOCEntry: ReCodEx

- _What files can be submitted to ReCodEx?_

  You can submit multiple files of any type to ReCodEx. There is a limit of
  **20** files per submission, with a total size of **20MB**.

- _What file does ReCodEx execute and what arguments does it use?_

  Exactly one file with `py` suffix must contain a line starting with `def main(`.
  Such a file is imported by ReCodEx and the `main` method is executed
  (during the import, `__name__ == "__recodex__"`).

  The file must also export an argument parser called `parser`. ReCodEx uses its
  arguments and default values, but it overwrites some of the arguments
  depending on the test being executed; the template always indicates which
  arguments are set by ReCodEx and which are left intact.

- _What are the time and memory limits?_

  The memory limit during evaluation is **1.5GB**. The time limit varies, but it should
  be at least 10 seconds and at least twice the running time of my solution.

- _Do agents need to be trained directly in ReCodEx?_

  No, you can pre-train your agent locally (unless specified otherwise in the task
  description).
